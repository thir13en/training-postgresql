# PostgreSQL Training

A place to drop notes on the process of learning postgresql

## What is it?
PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It supports transactions with ACID properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures. PostgreSQL is versatile, operating on major systems like Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, macOS, and Windows, suitable for various workloads from single machines to data warehouses with many concurrent users.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses on developing the core database engine, while a vibrant community and ecosystem contribute additional features traditionally provided by proprietary software vendors. This includes specialized features like geospatial or temporal databases and user interface features such as graphical interfaces. The PostgreSQL ecosystem, consisting of individuals, companies, products, and projects, plays a crucial role in the adoption and use of the database engine.

Originally named POSTGRES, PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley, aiming to address the limitations of contemporary database systems. The project began in 1985, led by Michael Stonebraker, and was later renamed PostgreSQL in 1996 to reflect its SQL support. The database's history includes the release of Postgres95, the establishment of the first non-university development server in 1996, and ongoing global development with regular releases under the PostgreSQL License.
